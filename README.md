# 2D to 3D High Resolution image conversion using generative GANs

### Objective
We exist in a three-dimensional universe but its two-dimensional (2D) representations are all we see. One of the key computer vision problems is to derive from their 2D representations the 3D forms of the objects. Initially it used 2D images to market an object. But as we are in an advanced era, where you can use 3D objects and photographs to make an object attractive. This will help to improve the company business. The picture or 3d forms that are available in the current market are of low resolution. Consequently of which the shapes and pixels often appear to be disoriented, distorted and not obvious. This project aims to create high-resolution images from the lower resolution and transforms low-dimensional probabilistic space using GANs to the space of 3D objects.
